# IRIS
IRIS is a project that deals with classfication of flowers based on the petal and sepal features. 
Dataset : I used the IRIS dataset.

Steps:
1. Created a python notebook and used different classification algorithm to classify flower.
2. Created a pickle file to predict foreign data.
3. Used Flask framework to host the webform to retrieve data for prediction.
